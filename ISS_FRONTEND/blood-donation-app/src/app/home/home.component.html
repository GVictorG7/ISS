  <p class="infos secundar">Blood is essential to life.
    Blood circulates through our body and delivers essential substances like oxygen and nutrients to the body’s cells.
    It also transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. There is no substitute for blood.
    It cannot be made or manufactured. Generous blood donors are the only source of blood for patients in need of
    a blood transfusion.

    <h5 class="subtitles">Blood Components</h5>
    <p class="infos">There are four basic components that comprise human blood: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.</p>
    <img src="bloodComponents.jpg" alt="blood components"> <br>
    <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
    <h5 class="subtitles">Red Blood Cells</h5>
    <p class="infos">Red blood cells represent 40%-45% of your blood volume.
      They are generated from your bone marrow at a rate of four to five billion per hour.
      They have a lifecycle of about 120 days in the body.
    </p>
    <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
    <h5 class="subtitles">Platelets</h5>
    <p class="infos">
      Platelets are an amazing part of your blood.
      Platelets are the smallest of our blood cells and literally look like small plates in their non-active form.
      Platelets control bleeding. Wherever a wound occurs, the blood vessel will send out a signal.
      Platelets receive that signal and travel to the area and transform into their “active” formation,
      growing long tentacles to make contact with the vessel and form clusters to plug the wound until it heals.
    </p>
    <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
    <h5 class="subtitles">Plasma</h5>
    <p class="infos">
      Plasma is the liquid portion of your blood.
      Plasma is yellowish in color and is made up mostly of water, but it also contains proteins, sugars, hormones and salts.
      It transports water and nutrients to your body’s tissues.
    </p>
    <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
    <h5 class="subtitles">White Blood Cells</h5>
    <p class="infos">
      Although white blood cells (leukocytes) only account for about 1% of your blood, they are very important.
      White blood cells are essential for good health and protection against illness and disease.
      Like red blood cells, they are constantly being generated from your bone marrow.
      They flow through the bloodstream and attack foreign bodies, like viruses and bacteria.
      They can even leave the bloodstream to extend the fight into tissue.

  <h6 class="infos">Here are some interesting and alarming facts about donating blood that may make you more keen to get down and donate.</h6>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Donating Blood Is Good For Your Heart</h5>
  <p class="infos">Blood flow and blood volume is integral to keeping the heart beating. However, while it may sound counterintuitive, regularly donating blood can actually improve heart health, not compromise it. According to Blood Flow Online, donating blood regularly can help to reduce how thick and sticky your blood is, thus allowing blood to flow more easily through the blood vessels and reach the heart faster.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Donating Blood Lowers Your Cancer Risk</h5>
  <p class="infos">Donating blood can reduce the donor's risk of developing cancer. Iron, one of the main minerals found in blood, has been known to increase the amount of free-radical damage in the body. However, a 2008 study found that donating blood helps reduce iron stores, thus reducing overall individual cancer risk.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles"> Could Justify Skipping A Workout</h5>
  <p class="infos">If saving the lives of others and improving your own personal health isn’t enough to get you to donate blood, how about the possible weight loss advantages. According to LiveStrong, you can burn about 650 calories per donation of one pint of blood —that's even more than what you burn in a 30 minute run!</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">One Man Saved 2 Million Babies Due To His Rare Blood</h5>
  <p class="infos">While it’s estimated that the average person can save about 1,000 lives in a lifetime due to donating blood, James Harrison was able to save around 2 million due to his rare blood type. Harrison’s blood contained high levels of an antibody known as anti-D immunoglobulin which was specifically used to help babies with a condition known as Rhesus disease. In short, the immune system of mothers carrying babies with Rhesus disease attacks the fetus. However, a transfusion of Harrison’s blood can prevent such an attack.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Coconut Water Can Be Used As Substitute In Emergency</h5>
  <p class="infos">According to ABC Science, in the case of an emergency, medical professionals can substitute coconut water as an alternative to plasma. Although the two are far from identical, coconut water has about one-fortieth the sodium level of plasma, while the potassium level is about 10-15 times higher. In the case where there is no IV available for a dehydrated patient, drinking coconut water will do.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Most Blood Goes To Cancer Patients</h5>
  <p class="infos">We may picture road-side trauma when we imagine where blood donations go, but in reality, only about 2 percent of all blood donations go to trauma patients. It’s actually cancer patients who receive the most blood.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Blood Shortages Happen Most During The Holidays</h5>
  <p class="infos">Everyone tends to get a bit busy over the holiday, and blood donation trends show this. According to the Community Blood Bank of Northwest Pennsylvania and Western New York, blood shortages happen most during summer and winter holidays, so this is when you should keep the practice in mind most.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles">Someone Needs Blood Every Two Seconds In The U.S.</h5>
  <p class="infos">It’s hard to imagine just how important blood donations are, but according to the American Red Cross, someone in the U.S. is in need of blood every two seconds. Aside from those with cancer and trauma patients, blood donations are also used for surgeries, obstetrics, and patients with specific blood disorders.</p>
  <span class="fa fa-genderless secundar"></span>
  <h5 class="subtitles"> Type O Positive Blood Is The Most Commonly Needed </h5>
  <p class="infos">Although all types of blood are needed and accepted, type O positive is the most needed. It's the most common blood type, so it's the most likely to be to transfused.</p>

<div id="Types" class="tabContent">
  <span class="fa fa-info-circle secundar"> <p class="title" >Types</p> </span>
  <p class="infos">
    Blood groups categorize blood based on the presence and absence of certain antibodies.
    The groupings also take into account antigens on the surface of the blood cells.
    Antibodies are proteins in plasma that alert the immune system to the presence of potentially harmful
    foreign substances. The immune system will attack the threat of disease or infection.
    Antigens are protein molecules on the surface of red blood cells.
  </p>
  <p class="infos">
    When giving or receiving organ donations or blood transfusions, the blood group of an
    individual becomes extremely important. Antibodies will attack new blood cells if they have an unrecognizable
    antigen, and this can lead to life-threatening complications. For example, anti-A antibodies will attack cells
    that have A antigens. RBCs sometimes contain another antigen called RhD. This is also noted as part of the
    blood group. A positive blood group means that RhD is present.
  </p>
  <p class="infos">
    Humans can have one of four main blood groups.
    Each of these groups can be Rhd positive or negative, forming eight main categories. <br>
    <b class="bloodgroup">Group A positive or A negative</b>: A antigens are found on the surfaces of blood cells. Anti-B antibodies are found in the plasma.<br>
    <b class="bloodgroup">Group B positive or B negative</b>: B antigens are found on the surfaces of blood cells. Anti-A antibodies are found in the plasma.<br>
    <b class="bloodgroup">Group AB positive or AB negative</b>: A and B antigens are found on the surfaces of blood cells. There are no antibodies are found in the plasma.<br>
    <b class="bloodgroup">Group O positive and O negative</b>: There are no antigens are found on the surfaces of blood cells. Both anti-B and anti-A antibodies are found in the plasma.
  </p>
  <p class="infos">
    Blood groups are important during pregnancy. If a woman has RhD negative blood, for example,
    but her fetus inherits RhD positive blood from the father, treatment will be needed to prevent a condition
    known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).

  <h5 class="subtitles"> Compatibility </h5>
  <p class="infos">Type matters when it comes to blood transfusions.
    There are very specific ways in which blood types and blood components must be matched for a safe transfusion.
    This is why it is important that you Target Your Type® with the best donation method for you.

  <h5 class="subtitles" style="padding-left:20px;color:white">What Happens to Donated Blood ?</h5> <br>
  <h6 class="subtitles"> The Donation </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    You arrive for your blood donation appointment.
    Health history and mini physical are completed.
    For a whole blood donation, about 1 pint of blood is collected; several small test tubes of blood are also collected for testing.
    Your donation, test tubes and your donor record are labeled with an identical bar code label.
    Your donation is kept on ice before being taken to a Red Cross center for processing; the test tubes go to the lab.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subtitles"> Processing </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    At our processing center, information about your donation is scanned into a computer database.
    Most whole blood donations are spun in centrifuges to separate it into transfusable components: red cells, platelets, and plasma.
    Plasma may be processed into components such as cryoprecipitate, which helps control the risk of bleeding by helping blood to clot.
    Red cells and platelets are leuko-reduced, which means your white cells are removed in order to reduce the possibility of the recipient having a reaction to the transfusion.
    Each component is packaged as a “unit,” a standardized amount that doctors will use when transfusing a patient.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subtitles"> Testing </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    In parallel with Step 2, your test tubes arrive at a testing laboratory.
    A dozen tests are performed, to establish the blood type and test for infectious diseases. Learn More About Tests Performed.
    Test results are transferred electronically to the processing center within 24 hours.
    If a test result is positive, your donation will be discarded and you will be notified (our test results are confidential and are only shared with the donor, except as may be required by law).
  </p>
  <h6 class="subtitles"> Storage </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    When test results are received, units suitable for transfusion are labeled and stored.
    Red cells are stored in refrigerators at 6ºC for up to 42 days.
    Platelets are stored at room temperature in agitators for up to five days.
    Plasma and cryo are frozen and stored in freezers for up to one year.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subtitles"> Distribution </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    Blood is available to be shipped to hospitals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
    Hospitals typically keep some blood units on their shelves, but may call for more at any time, such as in case of large scale emergencies.
  </p>
  <h6 class="subtitles" > Transfusion </h6>
  <p class="infos">
    An ill or injured patient arrives at a hospital or treatment center.
    Physicians determine whether the patient requires a transfusion and, if so, which type.
    Blood transfusions are given to patients in a wide range of circumstances, including serious injuries (such as in a car crash) surgeries, child birth, anemia, blood disorders, cancer treatments, and many others. See How Blood Donations Help.
    A patient suffering from an iron deficiency or anemia may receive red blood cells to increase their hemoglobin and iron levels, improving the amount of oxygen in the body.
    Patients who are unable to make enough platelets, due to illness or chemotherapy, may receive platelet transfusions to stay healthy.
    Plasma transfusions are used for patients with liver failure, severe infections, and serious burns.
